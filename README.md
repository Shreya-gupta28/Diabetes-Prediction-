# Diabetes-Prediction-
This project employs Python, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for diabetes. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training using a dataset of relevant health metrics.
The project's goal is to create an accurate prediction tool that can identify individuals at risk of diabetes, enabling early intervention and personalized healthcare strategies to mitigate the condition's impact.
